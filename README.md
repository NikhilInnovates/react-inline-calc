# ⚡ Inline Calculator

> **A smart, modern calculator built with React.**  
> Enter expressions, get instant answers, and track your calculation journey-all in one place.

## 🚀 What’s Inside?

- **Live Expression Evaluation**  
  Type math expressions like `3.14 * 2 - 1` and get instant, precise results.
- **History at a Glance**  
  Every calculation is saved-review, learn, or clear your past with a click.
- **Error Handling**  
  Mistyped? You’ll get a friendly `"Wrong input!"` prompt instead of cryptic errors.
- **Clean UI, Built for You**  
  Powered by React and Material-UI (or plain HTML-your choice!), the interface is fast, accessible, and distraction-free.

## 🧠 How It Works

### Components

- **Calculator**  
  The app’s brain-manages state and orchestrates interactions.
- **ExpressionInput**  
  Where you type your math. Handles validation and triggers calculations.
- **Results**  
  Shows the latest answer and a running history.
- **Calculation (Logic)**  
  Parses and computes your expressions safely-no `eval()` here!

### Example

```
Input:   1.28 + 2.89
Output:  1.28 + 2.89 = 4.17
```

Malformed expressions?  
You’ll see: `Wrong input!`

## 🧪 Test Drive

Run all tests (logic + UI):

```bash
npm test
```

## 📝 Design Highlights

- **No `eval()`**: Secure, custom parser for arithmetic.
- **User-Centric**: Fast, keyboard-friendly, and forgiving.
- **History Sorted**: Most recent calculations always on top.
- **Clear All**: One click to wipe your history slate clean.

## 🌱 Room to Grow

Dreaming bigger? Here are some ideas:

- [ ] Parentheses for advanced math
- [ ] Exponents, roots, and scientific functions
- [ ] Define and use variables
- [ ] Dark/light mode toggle
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts for power users
